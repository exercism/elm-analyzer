{-| Specifies where the functions are called from.

`Anywhere` means the functions are searched through the whole module.

`TopFunction "functionA"` means the functions are searched only within `functionA` and the functions called by `functionA`.

-}
type CalledFrom
    = Anywhere
    | TopFunction FunctionName


{-| Functions that can be searched for.

`AnyFromExternalModule ["List", "Extra"]` means that we are looking for any function from the `List.Extra` module.

`FromExternalModule ["List", "Extra"] "find"` means that we a looking for a call to `List.Extra.find`.

Note that for searching for function that are automatically imported, like `round`, the module must be explicitely stated: `FromExternalModule ["Basics"] "round"`.

`FromSameModule "solve"` means that we are looking for a call to a top-level function defined in the same module.

{-| Type of search.

When searching for a list of functions, we can specify what constitutes a success.

Use `All` to make sure all functions are called, `None` to make sure no function is called, and `Some` to make sure at least one function is called.

-}
type Find
    = All
    | None
    | Some

    = NotFound CalledFunction
    | FoundAt Range


type Context
    = Context
        { functionDeclaration : Maybe FunctionName
        , calledFromRange : Maybe Range

        , callTree : Dict FunctionName (List (Node Expression))
        }


{-| Check if a list of functions are called from a module or a top-level function.

`calledFrom` indicates if the functions should be searched through the whole module (`Anywhere`) or within a particular function (`TopFunction functionA`).

`findFunctions` specifies the list of functions that we are looking for, for example `functions = [FromExternalModule ["List", "Extra"] "find", FromExternalModule ["List", "Extra"] "findIndex"]`.

`find` specifies the type of search. For example, we might want to forbid the use of `List.Extra.find` and `List.Extra.findIndex`, or maybe we want to make sure that one of these is being called, or even both.

`comment` is the comment that will be returned if the module doesn't satisfy the specifications.

Let's consider an example:

    module A exposing (..)

    functionA param = param
        |> functionB
        |> List.Extra.find List.isEmpty

    functionB param =
        |> List.Extra.findIndex (\(i, _) -> i > 0)
        |> List.map Tuple.second

The rule `functionCalls {calledFrom = Anywhere, findFunctions = functions, find = All, comment = comment}` would succeed since `List.Extra.find` and `List.Extra.findIndex` are both called somewhere in the module. Changing to `calledFrom = TopFunction "functionB"` would fail, since `functionB` only calls one of the two, and `comment` would be thrown.

`functionCalls` can keep track of imports and aliases.
If module `A` was using `import List.Extra exposing (find, findIndex)` or `import List.Extra as List`, the rule would behave the same.

`functionCalls` searches recursively through internal top-level functions calls.
This is particularly useful when helper functions are defined.
For example, the rule above with `calledFrom = TopFunction "functionA"` would succeed, since `functionA` calls `List.Extra.find` directly, also calls `functionB` that itself calls `List.Extra.findIndex`, therefore we consider that `functionA` calls both functions.
